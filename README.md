# Galton Board
## Simulation of a Galton board in Python 3

The Galton board has 12 rows of pegs arranged in a hex pattern. That is, all the pegs are the same distance apart.
A number of balls (30) are released at the top and find their way down the board by colliding with the pegs. Once a ball reached the bottom, it is counted in one of 24 buckets and a new ball injected at the top. The ball count is reflected graphically via moving dots, as is the distribution via a fitted curve.
